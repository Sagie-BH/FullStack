/*
In CSS, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are called "pseudo"
because they're not real classes or elements in the HTML markup. 
They are used to style certain parts of an HTML element, 
or to apply styles in specific scenarios.

1. Pseudo-classes: A pseudo-class is a keyword added to 
selectors that specifies a special state of the selected elements.
 For instance, `:hover` can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.

2. Pseudo-elements: A pseudo-element is a keyword 
added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s).
They can be used for decoration (`::before` and `::after`),
or to add a certain effect or layout to an element. 

For example, you might use the `::first-line` pseudo-element to style the first line of a paragraph.

In summary, the "pseudo" in pseudo-class and pseudo-element 
reflects their ability to select and style things 
that are not explicitly present in the document's HTML. 
They let you apply styles in more complex patterns than would be possible 
by just selecting existing elements by tag, class, or id.*/
